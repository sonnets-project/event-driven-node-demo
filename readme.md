What's This?
===

A minimum-worked example of a generic event-driven application. Its point: to
give some idea about what an event-driven application might look like in the
wild. Long story short:

 - I introduce the concept of a node (we call 'stack' here), an event, and an
   event driver. I then explain how these might map in code form.

 - The 'event-drivenness' of the application is divorced from the application
   logic. This means application developers can work independently, using some
   common event-driven infrastructure if desired.

This is not:

 - A specification

 - Well tested

 - To be trusted

It is simply an illustration.
